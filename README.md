### Hi there, I'm Arjit Agarwal 👋

I'm a **Full-Stack Engineer** specializing in **applied AI/ML**, building and scaling enterprise-grade applications where the front-end meets machine learning. I enjoy taking complex models and integrating them into robust, usable, real-world products.

🧠 **My Focus:**

* **Applied AI:** Building LLM-powered systems (RAG, Function Agents) and Computer Vision solutions (YOLOv4/DeepSORT).

* **Full-Stack Development:** Driving feature ownership using the **React/NextJS** frontend and **Python/FastAPI/NestJS** backend stack.

* **System Reliability:** Always setting a high bar for quality by automating testing and ensuring system stability (e.g., 85% code coverage with Playwright/Jest).

🛠️ **My Core Toolkit:**
`Python` | `TypeScript` | `React/Next.js` | `FastAPI` | `PostgreSQL` | `TensorFlow` | `LangChain` | `Docker` | `Kubernetes`
